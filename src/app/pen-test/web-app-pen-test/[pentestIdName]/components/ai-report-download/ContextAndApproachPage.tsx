      <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Context of the Mandate</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        S2 Cyber Security is a revolutionary technology enabler for all industries. They enable organizations to leverage diverse technologies in a holistic way, to bring their business’ real purpose to life. They conceived, built and deliver their orchestration platform, Ikon, as a multi-tenant, universally adaptable technology platform. It is sector-neutral, system friendly and comfortable in all business environments, on the cloud or on premise.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        To evaluate the various components of its information security posture, S2 Cyber Security mandated Keross to perform web application vulnerability testing. The main goal was to discover vulnerabilities, validate them using proof-of-concept exploits, and determine the overall risks of exposure to security threats that could compromise the organization’s infrastructures and its related IT assets.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This report includes an executive summary that clearly describes the organization’s security posture and offers various recommendations to deal with problems encountered during the mandate.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In addition, any missing security controls identified within the course of this engagement is further developed and given a priority level based on the associated risks and aggravating factors (see <Text style={styles.appendixRef}>Appendix 2 - Security Controls</Text> for more details).
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Finally, each vulnerability presented is elaborated and classified using a risk scale based on the standardized vulnerability assessment system for criticality (CVSS) (see <Text style={styles.appendixRef}>Appendix 3 - Vulnerability Scoring</Text> for more details).
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This level of detail and criticality will enable S2 Cyber Security’ technical team to strategically deploy security efforts and according to the various metrics available.

    {/* Our Penetration Testing Approach */}

      <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Our Penetration Testing Approach</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Penetration testing, also referred to as ethical hacking, is a comprehensive service that enables the Client to assess the resilience of its infrastructure against cyberattacks. Using our proven methodology, our skilled and experienced testers simulate real-world attack scenarios in order to compromise the Client’s strategic business assets and assess its security posture.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Recognized and validated approaches such as OWASP, OSSTMM, PTES, ISO or NIST, in combination with internally developed tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), will be used to provide a specific action plan that enables the Client to reduce its risks.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Based upon the OSSTMM and PTES, our method of performing penetration testing is divided into four steps (see <Text style={styles.appendixRef}>Appendix 1 - Testing Methodology</Text> for more details). The first step consists of recognizing and scanning the targeted systems. Once this step is completed, a vulnerability search is performed in these systems. The identified vulnerabilities will be analyzed, verified, and tested. The final step consists of a detailed analysis of the impacts and the drafting of the final report, which integrates the test results and our recommendations to mitigate the risks.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Our team fulfills the necessary requirements using dynamic vulnerability scanning, static analysis, manual penetration testing, and threat modelling. We determine any vulnerabilities within the organization’s network, web, and mobile applications in order to help the Client secure its infrastructure, systems, applications, and data.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Once the vulnerabilities are identified, we provide recommendations to mitigate them to acceptable risk levels for the organization. The results yield a roadmap for the Client to better understand the security risks and the efforts required to improve the overall security posture of the organization.
